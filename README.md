# RecipeBox-Angular
 RecipeBox app using MEAN stack

 ## Intent

 RecipeBox should show a dashboard of all the recipes as recipe cards,
 you should be able to delete a recipe from this view.

 If you clicked a recipe card it should take you to the recipe page
 where you can edit the recipe, this currently isn't operational

 At the top of the navbar there is the option to add a recipe, this link will
 take you to the add recipe page where you will be able to add a recipe

 ## Current todos

 - Fix clicking on a card brings you to the page
 - Add verification to the add recipe component
 - style it more (currently looks like a 2000's webpage)
